## Assignment in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).
SOA or Service Oriented Architecture is a kind of aproach to software development which allows the user to
fully utalize the software components and services of a system, this can help big companies such as Microsoft 
to offer much greater benifits to thier user as they can reuse parts of a software to create a new software for a
different perpose

2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
╚First of the characteristic of the SOA is the Standardized Service Contracts, as the name sugest, these are services
that use service contracts.
╚Next is the Loose Coupling, this characteristic of the SOA allows the Services offered by the software to have 
minimal dependencies, this is to ensure that every service contract has their on dependencies onces implemented.
╚Thirdly is the Abstraction, this characteristic of the SOA allows the services to avoid any unessesary data leak
and hides information to protect the services privacy as it allows the preservation of relationship and dependencies
that have been implemented.
╚The Fourth characteristic of the SOA is Service Reusability, this part of the SOA,as the name suggest, allows the services 
to be reused as much as possible.
╚Fifth characteristic of the SOA is Autonomy, this, as the name would imply, makes it so that the SOA can act autonomously
by itself and allows the software to run without the help of outside interference, this allows the services to be much more
reliable as it can run by itself.
╚The Sixth characteristic of SOA is Statelessness, this ensures that the services to be stateless, allowing the service to be far
more scalable as it has no constant state.
╚The Seventh SOA characteristic is Discoverability, this allows the services to be discovered at any given moment as the 
metadata can be stored in a document.
╚The Eight SOA characteristic is Composability, this allows the services to breakup problems into much smaller problems
which can help with the reusability of a servicesm it also allows the services to be much more efficient that it already is.
╚The final characteristic of SOA is the Interoperability this allows the software services to much effectively make use
of the information  it is provided which would allow the services to attune to the users.

3. Define Microservices.
Microservices is similar to SOA as it utalize the reusable software component the only difference being that microservices
focuses on a single applications

4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
╚Firstly is Independently deployable,one of its benifits is that it can be deployed independently, this is becauase it only 
need to focus on a single service.
╚Another one of the benifits of microservices is that since it focuses on single applications it can utalize all of its 
fucntion just to focus on that one services it needs to operate
╚Lastly is that microservices can be precisely scaled as they only need focus on single services, which  in turn manimizes
the amount of infrustructure that it would need as it would only need to single out an application.

5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
As discussed earlier the SOA and Microservices are similar in that both uses reusability to maximize the use of services that
they can bring, however the difference between the two is that first of all the Microservices are faster that SOA as the
microservices only need to focus on a single application.
Nextly is that since SOA focuses on wide range services while the microservices focuses on singular service application
Lastly is scallabiliy, as said earlier since SOA is much wide range than microservices it would also mean that the scale on which
they can be applied as is also in a different scale.
